Alternatively, the address argument can be a valid host DNS name. The mask argument expressed in dotted-quad form defaults to 255.255.255.255, meaning that the address is treated as the address of an individual host. A default entry (address 0.0.0.0, mask 0.0.0.0) is always included and is always the first entry in the list. Note: the text string default, with no mask option, may be used to indicate the default entry. The ippeerlimit directive limits the number of peer requests for each IP to int, where a value of -1 means \"unlimited\", the current default. A value of 0 means \"none\". There would usually be at most 1 peering request per IP, but if the remote peering requests are behind a proxy there could well be more than 1 per IP. In the current implementation, flag always restricts access, i.e., an entry with no flags indicates that free access to the server is to be given. The flags are not orthogonal, in that more restrictive flags will often make less restrictive ones redundant. The flags can generally be classed into two categories, those which restrict time service and those which restrict informational queries and attempts to do run-time reconfiguration of the server. One or more of the following flags may be specified: kod - If this flag is set when an access violation occurs, a kiss-o'-death (KoD) packet is sent. KoD packets are rate limited to no more than one per second. If another KoD packet occurs within one second after the last one, the packet is dropped. limited - Deny service if the packet spacing violates the lower limits specified in the discard command. A history of clients is kept using the monitoring capability of ntpd. Thus, monitoring is always active as long as there is a restriction entry with the limited flag. lowpriotrap - Declare traps set by matching hosts to be low priority. The number of traps a server can maintain is limited (the current limit is 3). Traps are usually assigned on a first come, first served basis, with later trap requestors being denied service. This flag modifies the assignment algorithm by allowing low priority traps to be overridden by later requests for normal priority traps. noepeer - Deny ephemeral peer requests, even if they come from an authenticated source.

sca.check.title: Ensure ntp access control is configured.
sca.check.description: ntp Access Control Commands: restrict address [mask mask] [ippeerlimit int] [flag ...] The address argument expressed in dotted-quad form is the address of a host or network. Alternatively, the address argument can be a valid host DNS name. The mask argument expressed in dotted-quad form defaults to 255.255.255.255, meaning that the address is treated as the address of an individual host. A default entry (address 0.0.0.0, mask 0.0.0.0) is always included and is always the first entry in the list. Note: the text string default, with no mask option, may be used to indicate the default entry. The ippeerlimit directive limits the number of peer requests for each IP to int, where a value of -1 means "unlimited", the current default. A value of 0 means "none". There would usually be at most 1 peering request per IP, but if the remote peering requests are behind a proxy there could well be more than 1 per IP. In the current implementation, flag always restricts access, i.e., an entry with no flags indicates that free access to the server is to be given. The flags are not orthogonal, in that more restrictive flags will often make less restrictive ones redundant. The flags can generally be classed into two categories, those which restrict time service and those which restrict informational queries and attempts to do run-time reconfiguration of the server. One or more of the following flags may be specified: kod - If this flag is set when an access violation occurs, a kiss-o'-death (KoD) packet is sent. KoD packets are rate limited to no more than one per second. If another KoD packet occurs within one second after the last one, the packet is dropped. limited - Deny service if the packet spacing violates the lower limits specified in the discard command. A history of clients is kept using the monitoring capability of ntpd. Thus, monitoring is always active as long as there is a restriction entry with the limited flag. lowpriotrap - Declare traps set by matching hosts to be low priority. The number of traps a server can maintain is limited (the current limit is 3). Traps are usually assigned on a first come, first served basis, with later trap requestors being denied service. This flag modifies the assignment algorithm by allowing low priority traps to be overridden by later requests for normal priority traps. noepeer - Deny ephemeral peer requests, even if they come from an authenticated source. Note that the ability to use a symmetric key for authentication may be restricted to one or more IPs or subnets via the third field of the ntp.keys file. This restriction is not enabled by default, to maintain backward compatibility.

Time service is not affected. nopeer - Deny unauthenticated packets which would result in mobilizing a new association.

sca.check.title: Ensure cryptographic mechanisms are used to protect the integrity of audit tools.
sca.check.description: Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.
sca.check.rationale: Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit information. Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity. Attackers may replace the audit tools or inject code into the existing tools with the purpose of providing the capability to hide or erase system activity from the audit logs. Audit tools should be cryptographically signed in order to provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified, manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or files.

sca.check.description: The /etc/cron.d directory contains system cron jobs that need to run in a similar manner to the hourly, daily weekly and monthly jobs from /etc/crontab, but require more granular control as to when they run. The files in this directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are instead edited by system administrators using a text editor. The commands below restrict read/write and search access to user and group root, preventing regular users from accessing this directory. Note: Other methods, such as systemd timers, exist for scheduling jobs. If another method is used, cron should be removed, and the alternate method should be secured in accordance with local site policy.
sca.check.rationale: Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged users could provide them the means for gaining unauthorized elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain elevated privileges or circumvent auditing controls.

sca.check.title: Ensure shadow group is empty.
sca.check.description: The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability to read the /etc/shadow file. No users should be assigned to the shadow group.
sca.check.rationale: Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the /etc/shadow file. If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed passwords to break them. Other security information that is stored in the /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert additional user accounts.
sca.check.remediation: Run the following command to remove all users from the shadow group # sed -ri 's/(^shadow:[^:]*:[^:]*:)([^:]+$)/\1/' /etc/group Change the primary group of any users with shadow as their primary group. # usermod -g <primary group> <user>
